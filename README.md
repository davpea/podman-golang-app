# podman-golang-app
Build and run containerised go app based off the Red Hat RHEL 9 UBI using Podman Desktop

I'm using the getting started guide >> https://podman-desktop.io/docs/getting-started/getting-started and also referencing the blog post about UBI's here >> https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/11/30/build-lightweight-and-secure-container-images-using-rhel-ubi#choose_the_ubi_image_for_your_build

I'm using code form https://github.com/alexellis and https://github.com/ksingh7  as the basis for my experimentation, and using the latest version of Golang and Podman available in July 2023.
